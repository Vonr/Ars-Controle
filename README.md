### Warping Spell Prism ![](https://github.com/Vonr/Ars-Controle/blob/1.20.x/src/main/resources/assets/ars_controle/textures/block/warping_spell_prism.png?raw=true)

The Warping Spell Prism allows you to warp a spell projectile to anywhere in the world, even across dimensions -
as long as both the prism and the destination are loaded.

### Remote ![](https://github.com/Vonr/Ars-Controle/blob/1.20.x/src/main/resources/assets/ars_controle/textures/item/remote.png?raw=true)

The Remote is an item that lets you remotely configure blocks such as the Warping Spell Prism and Storage Lectern.
(Currently only supports those two blocks, more may be added in the future.)

To use it, first use it on the block you would like to configure.
Then, you can use it again on other blocks or entities depending on what the block you are configuring accepts.

The remote will allow for cross dimensional configuration of the Warping Spell Prism, unlike the Dominion Wand
which does not store dimensions.
